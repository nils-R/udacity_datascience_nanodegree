 * Include a README file detailing the files in your package and how to install the package.
 * Comment your code - use docstrings and inline comments where appropriate.
 * Refactor code when possible - if you find your functions are getting too long, then refactor your code!
 * Use object-oriented programming whenever it makes sense to do so.
 * You're encouraged to write unit tests! The coding exercises in this lesson contained unit tests, so you can use those tests as a model for your package.
 * Use GitHub for version control, and commit your work often.

As a reminder, your package should be placed in a folder with the following folders and files:

* A folder with the name of your package that contains:
 - the Python code that makes up your package
 - a README.md file
 - an __init__.py
 - license.txt
 - setup.cfg

* setup.py file
