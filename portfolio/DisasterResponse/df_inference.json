For other diseases in this category, such as giardiasis and infection by helminths (such as hookworm), no data were readily available as these diseases are not notifiable. According to official government assessments, approximately 184,000 hectares of oil palm plantations were affected by lowland flooding. CARE International, the world's third largest aid agency, is warning a serious public health threat could be on the way as the floodwater recedes. In other areas, the parasitic weed, Striga hermonitheca (witchweed), which is especially problematic on Sorghum grown in nutrient poor soils, is now widespread throughout the rain-dependent cropping areas of northern Ethiopia, where it significant lowers potential crop yields. JAKARTA, Jan 24 (AFP) - A strong earthquake shook Indonesia's Sulawesi island Monday, damaging dozens of shops and homes and prompting thousands to flee for fear of a repeat of last month's tsunami disaster. Besides, other projects have also been supported such as: planting mangrove forest, enhancing capacity of community; transferring clean technology, clean development mechanism, eliminating substances causing ozone depletion, etc. Another earthquake shakes north-eastern Afghanistan. Israel offered assistance to Pakistan after a massive 7.6-magnitude earthquake rattled the country on October 8, despite the absence of relations between the two countries. ROME - The connection between climate and hunger was made abundantly clear this summer when torrential rain lashed Pakistan, causing devastating flooding that submerged farmland, obliterated crops and left 10 million people in need of food aid. The scale of the rehabilitation programme, in addition to the difficult environment, particularly the incessant monsoon rain and the acute shortage of masons, has resulted in a further extension of the operation until 31 December 2000. Its deadliest eruption occurred in 1930 when more than 1,300 people were killed. In addition to Assam, West Bengal and Bihar, the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Andra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Marahastra have also experienced extensive flooding caused by the seasonal monsoon rains. While the country grapples with rising food prices, there are daily power cuts lasting three hours and 20mins in 78 regions with high electricity consumption as the hydropower sector buckles under more intense heat and quicker water evaporation. Famine Early Warning System (FEWS)/Somalia estimates losses of Gu'crops in traditional underground granaries due to floods and rain water seepage at 31,1000 tones. The Branch, with Appeal funds, successfully completed the water distribution and support programme, delivering containers and water via the Branch ambulance boat. It is a project, which will be implemented in all tsunami-affected districts before the monsoon winds and rain begin in October. The earthquake rocked the region around 6 a.m. Saturday killing more than 5,100 people, seriously injuring 6,500 and leaving 200,000 homeless, according to the Indonesian government. We also encourage medical workers - nurses, doctors, and physicians assistants - who are interested in joining this historic response to register at www.usaid.gov/ebola/volunteers. BPPTK Yogyakarta reported that 178 multi phase tremors, 3 shallow volcanic tremors and one tectonic tremor occurred on Monday (24 Apr.). We predicted snowfall in the end of November, and it is the beginning of the harsh weather now.\"",

Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed. The Swiss Ministry for Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is also preparing to send emergency power generators and medicine. The strongest wind force measured near the centre of Tropical Depression No. 8 was at Beaufort Scale 6 (39 to 49 kilometres per hour), with wind gusting to above Beaufort Scale 6. The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. * Reduced mortality and morbidity among women, adolescents and children due to post-flood outbreak of communicable and infectious diseases. The Miyagi government said the series of major quakes had caused damage estimated at least 120 million yen (one million dollars) to the farming and fisheries industries in the area. However, there is normally a risk of late season pests such as quelea birds, sweet potato butterfly, stem-borers, African bollworm, stem rust, Welo bush cricket (affecting wheat, barley and teff), shoot-fly (affecting teff) and even locust at the end of the kiremt rains and before the main harvest. The Board approved assistance grants to five Muslim Communities in non member countries in India, USA, Malawi, Mauritius and Russia, in addition to educational grants to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia. Among the 19 provinces affected by the three weeks of storms, were the badly-hit southern Chinese provinces of Hunan and Guizhou, more famed for their chilli peppers and subtropical climate than for heavy snow. In the Broghal and Yarkhoon valleys of Chitral District (Northern Areas), some 4000 vulnerable persons are completely cut off and isolated as a result of continuous snowfall since December 2004. WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. \"The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,\" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless. Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades\", said the CSE.",

The severe drought parching east Africa has left 10 million facing hunger and the scope of one of the world's worst unfolding humanitarian disasters conjured up memories of Ethiopia's devastating 1984 famine. Seismologists agree that Padang will face more earthquakes in future, and warn that a much larger quake with far greater destructive force is inevitable in the region. The flash floods that followed torrential monsoonal rains in north-west Pakistan between 28 and 30 July have caused great loss of life and wide-spread damage to infrastructure, livestock and property in more than 100 villages. Lesotho and Swaziland would also experience scattered rains, he noted. But while floodwaters have subsided in some areas, there has been fresh flooding in the north of the state and more heavy rainfall forecast elsewhere. Approximately 1.9 million people have been affected in the past week by heavy torrential monsoon rains which flooded 195 blocks in 14 districts of the State of West Bengal. Separately, the West Java administration has said it plans to once more dredge the Citarum river to reduce the mass of sedimentation that contributes to the area's annual floods. With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days. The initial assessments indicated that nearly 15,000 people had been affected - already double the estimates made on Tuesday - with over 8,000 left without shelter and two people dead. The southern African nation of Mozambique has once again been inundated by flood waters and hurricane force winds. Furthermore, the most recent cyclone to hit the country, tropical storm Manou, killed more than 70 people in May, severed roads and bridges and caused extensive damage to agricultural land. A blanket of acrid smog covered the sweltering capital itself, worsening the woes of Muscovites gasping in Russia's hottest weather since record-keeping began around 1880. Where localised flooding has forced the evacuation of whole communities, the authorities have moved residents to safer areas. This rapid-response shipment includes critically needed supplies to care for the thousands injured in Saturday's disaster: first-aid supplies, materials for making casts to set broken arms and legs, walkers, canes, crutches, warm weather clothing for hospital patients and hygiene kits. Further bad weather is predicted, with the government issuing a cyclone warning for Karachi and other coastal communities in the coming days. Two people were killed when a tree uprooted by the wind fell on them at a village in Chandpur district 170 km (106 miles) southeast of the capital Dhaka on Sunday. 4-7 February: Torrential rain coupled with seasonal rainfall leads to some of the worst flooding in Mozambique in more than half a century. The pledges made, in order of magnitude in terms of per annum commitments, included the following:. The cyclone and subsequent flooding in Baluchistan have killed 25 people, while 12 people were killed on Thursday in a separate deluge in the northwest of the country. More funds are needed to provide medicines, food and shelter. In the wake of the system temperatures are forecast to fall far below zero, with accompanying wind chill factor. By Himadri Ahsan, IFRC The monsoon depression over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh coast intensified into a cyclonic storm named 'Komen' on Wednesday, 29 July, threatening to cause further downpours in regions that are already affected by the recent flash floods and deadly landslides. Freaky winter storms have plagued southern China since mid-January, leading to widespread traffic jams, structural collapse, blackouts and crop loss in 21 provincial-level regions. Skin diseases due to poor hygiene or biting insects are widespread and reported to be a major problem in Dadu district. Roiling floods triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rain have scoured Pakistan's Indus river basin, killing more than 1,600 people, forcing 2 million from their homes and disrupting the lives of about 14 million people, or 8 percent of the population. JAKARTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia's neighbors on Friday sent in firefighters to train Indonesian crews battling bushfires on Sumatra island as the haze-making blazes spread.

To keep their herd alive, she corralled the animals into tight pens while her husband Batdorj trudged into the darkness and blowing snow to look for strays. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. While on the visit of the village after the storm, the Prime Minister Edward Lowasa called on the people to build stronger structures for safer housing of their families and plant more trees that would act as wind breakers during stormy weather. A State of Emergency was declared today (21 August) by the authorities in Hunan Province while the water level of Dongting Lake, the second largest fresh water lake in China, continues to rise (Dongting Lake acts as a giant overflow for the flood prone Yangtze River). The agency said the intermittent downpours of the last several days would be followed by heavy rains and perhaps even tornadoes. National experts in infrastructure damage assessment (six weeks). Luoyang city experienced six days of continuous heavy rain, with the average daily rainfall reaching 100 millimeters (four inches), the report said. The KRCS has been distributing mosquito nets in a bid to prevent malaria epidemics. Having its origin in the Chitral Gol National Park, the stream was seen carrying with it a large number of deodar logs. In addition, it is extremely prone to natural disasters; such as floods, drought, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, snowfall, typhoons and cyclones which have important social and economic consequences. BEIJING, Aug 5, 2006 (AFP) - Typhoon Prapiroon killed at least 31 people and left 14 others missing after crashing ashore in southern China, state media reported Saturday, announcing the latest casualty figures. Reports indicate at least 40 people were killed and more than 180 others injured following the earthquake that struck south-east Iran deep beneath the surface with tremors felt across Pakistan, India and the Gulf States. To date, authorities have listed 190 Fukushima workers as victims of radiation sickness, the most acute form of radiation exposure that results in damage to multiple organ systems, skin burns, and usually a slow deterioration and death. MADRID, March 18 (Reuters) - International humanitarian groups are finding pockets of suffering in northern Japan, but say most victims of the earthquake, tsunami, and snow blizzards are keeping warm and getting food, water and medical attention. Papua New Guinea is on the Pacific volcanic belt known as the ''Ring of Fire,'' and has more than a dozen active volcanoes. KYANGIN  -  Due to the rising tides of Ayeyawady River from erosion, 13 families from four villages in Yelekyun village in Kyangin Township were evacuated to safer locations on 3 September. MUMBAI, July 5, 2006 (AFP) - Large tracts of India's western financial hub of Mumbai were under water Wednesday as the weather bureau warned further heavy rains were on the way and the death toll from the monsoon deluge rose to nine.

TOKYO, Dec 28, 2004 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Japan Tuesday sent a Maritime Self- Defense Force convoy, including a helicopter, to waters off Thailand to help search for missing people following Sunday's earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in the Southeast and South Asian region. Only spotty light rain is expected during the period. Half of Bibi's tent floor was soaked in rain water, making the plunging temperatures nearly unbearable at night, she said. Recent snow flurries and fog have prevented the planned airdrops from taking place as frequently as had been hoped, and the increasingly muddy roads make truck convoys hazardous at times. On 17 August, approximately 25 veterinarians, sponsored by FAO, arrived in Badakhshan to commence the summer vaccination campaign. In Indonesia, CWS has focused on four main activities: emergency distribution of food and non-food items for over 12,000 internally displaced people in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar; a mobile clinic medical team and a psychosocial mental health team serving displaced people; and water supply and sanitation in Meulaboh. The national seismological network said the quake jolted the juncture between Sichuan's Suining City and Tongnan County of Chongqing Municipality at 5:36 a.m. Weather officials said islands in the Bay of Bengal were gripped by high tides caused by monsoon clouds, and warned all fishing boats to return to their bases.

    "message": "As you can imagine, the WHO and all of us have been inundated with suggestions, from salt baths to chloroquine, and the usual suspects, steroids and statins, come up. The sewer water is gushing out of manholes in many areas of the city, which has a population of more than 10 million people. Inhabitants found it extremely hard to travel and had to suffer a real ordeal by having to use remote unmaintained roads and unconventional means of transport. Islandwide, 540,000 homes were left temporarily without power. Basic household items: The TRCO and the Federation have provided 5,205 families living in prefabricated houses with items such as blankets, quilts, a water boiler, and a radio. They included the provision of emergency shelters and winterisation kits, provision of transport and medical screening. At around 5:40 this morning, the MINUSMA compound in Kidal was targeted by a complex attack involving more than 30 rockets and shells. Many of the outbuildings that housed his tools, equipment, seeds and livestock collapsed in the earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, while others still teeter dangerously close. According to the TEPCO Press Release of 4th April, approximately 10,000 T of water from the radioactive waste treatment plant and 1,500 T of subsurface waters stored in the sub drain pits of Unit 5 and 6 are being discharged to the sea to provide room to store water with higher levels of radioactivity in a safer manner. Wagons loaded with GI sheets, bulldozers and water tank wagons directed for relief work. Often, evicted families are able to find other places to stay, but UNHCR tries to help negotiate with host families or find alternative accommodation, particularly in cases of elderly or other vulnerable people who have no other options. Afghan fruit growers have lost export earnings as a result of the UN Security Council's international flight ban on Afghanistan. They have an ingenious low cost, non-chemical strategy; introducing carp fingerlings and duckweed which will bring down bacteria levels by 95% (safe enough to bath in), over 15 days and 100% over the next week. Provincial and local authorities are mobilising human and material resouces to restore the cut telecommunications and transportation in the worst affected areas. After consultation with WHO, provision of first aid kits to community-sourced fire fighters as well as a number of non-pharmaceutical medicines (such as oral rehydration salts, antiseptics, sterile saline eyewash, etc.) is suggested. IR is now building permanent and earthquake resistant structures in Aceh, 100 of these have already been completed. However, the sources confirmed that all the nine gates of auxiliary spillway were operating round-the-clock and a large quantity of water, about 175,000 cusecs, was being released daily, while an additional release of 100,000 plus cusecs was also spilling out of the dam during the electricity generation process. The MISP also serves as the basis for building comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services throughout protracted crises and through the recovery phase, including preventing sexual violence and providing assistance to survivors. The UNICEF team visiting Kanyakumari was told in one such camp run by a local church that we may be on the brink of a diarrhoea epidemic\" with 4,000 people depending on 15 toilets in the church premises.",
